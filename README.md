# Web Application Development

This repository contains code for the project for the module Web Applications Development. The purpose of this module was to demonstrate understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

# Project 

The aim of the project was to create a website for a fictional website, for which I chose Planet Express from the TV show Futurama. The website needed to contain three linked pages, forms, DOM manipulation, charts. This repository can be downloaded from github and opening the home.html file gives a demonstration of how the website functions.

A real world work-in-progress website that I created based on this orignal design can be seen [here](https://akcoops.netlify.app). This website was built using the foundations I acquired from the web application development module and applied to Gatsby.js framework.
