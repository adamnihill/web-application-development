    <h3>Philip J. Fry</h3> 
    <!--Text in p tags taken from character's wiki page-->
    <p>Philip was a native to the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen seconds into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended. He was revived in 2999 and subsequently became a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company. </p> </div>

    <h3>Turanga Leela</h3>
    <p>With a "no rain or sleet" attitude and a "kick-your-ass" grace, this delivery captain is a refreshing source of professionalism to counterpoint the rest of the crew.</p>
    <p>For better or worse, the ship runs on her high octane passions, be it because of her longing for family, her love of violence, her commitment to a job well done, or her affection for animals.</p>   </div>

    <img id="imageRight" src="images/bender.jpg" alt="bender" hspace="20">
    <h3>Bender</h3>
    <p>Bender is also fascinated with cooking, though he is shown to have no sense of actual human taste, often creating dishes that can even kill plant life. He also thinks that humans eat rocks.</p>
    <p>Magnets, when attached to his head, cause him to lose his sense of inhibition and act like a folk singer.</p>
